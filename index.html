        <h1>Cloud Computing</h1>
            <p>Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet1. Instead of owning and maintaining physical data centers and servers, users can access technology services like computing power, storage, and databases from a cloud provider. Data, work, and applications are stored remotely in the cloud, and can be accessed from any device connected to the Internet</p>
    
        <h2>Data Virtualization</h2>
            <p> is the core technology that enables logical data management capabilities. Data virtualization establishes a single data-access layer for finding and using all enterprise data, comprised of logical/virtual representations of physical data sources like data warehouses, data lakes, transactional and analytical databases, cloud and enterprise applications' data services and APIs, and data files. With this centralized, logical layer, data virtualization enables real-time access to data stored across multiple heterogeneous data sources.</p>

        <h2>Data Virtualization Providers</h2>

        <h3>Red Hat</h3>
        <p>Red Hat Virtualization is an open-source enterprise platform that is in continual development. It supports both Linux and Windows workloads. Enterprises can manage their virtual machines through Red Hat Virtualization, building, migrating, and halting them when needed. Consider Red Hat if your company relies heavily on open-source software or uses Linux operating systems. </p>

        <h3>VMware</h3>
        <p>VMware vSphere is a cloud virtualization platform for running and managing applications.VMware provides one management console for updating and patching software in on-premises and cloud environments. If organizations want to run cloud-native applications on their existing IT infrastructure, they have the option to run vSphere with Tanzu, which permits containerized apps to run on mixed environments. </p>

        <h3>Oracle VM VirtualBox</h3>
        <p>Oracle VM VirtualBox is an open-source virtualization solution. For developers who regularly test software on multiple operating systems, VirtualBox is a sandbox environment that supports multiple operating systems, including Mac OS. VirtualBox is a free tool. </p>
